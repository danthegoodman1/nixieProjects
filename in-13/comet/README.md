Time to build something cool.

Originally called "Starburst", then changed to a myriad of names you can see listed, I made a terrible initial drawing concept:

It was initially called starburst because I wanted it to look like it was exploding, but found out that the bargraph was only visible from one half of the tube, so I had to angle them up so you wouldn't ever be looking at the back of a tube.
